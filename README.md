# Neural Network

## Overview of the analysis: 

Alphabet Soup offers donations to charitable organizations.  They want to ensure that their funds donated will be targeted towards a successful project.  <br>
In order to select which applicants receive a donation, an analysis has been done using [charity_data.csv](https://github.com/taranahassan/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/charity_data.csv), wch consists over 34,000 organizations that have been funded by Alphabet Soup in the past, the predictive mofel has been created


elp predict whether organizations might be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup. <br>
Using [charity_data.csv](https://github.com/taranahassan/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/charity_data.csv) which consists over 34,000 organizations that have been funded by Alphabet Soup in the past, the predictive mofel has been created.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation,
